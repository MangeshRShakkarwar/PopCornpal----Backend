- üåê **External APIs:** Integration with movie databases for real-time data.
- üìä **Admin Controls:** Endpoints for managing users and reviews.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js:** Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storage.
- **Mongoose:** MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **JWT:** JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **Axios:** HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Dotenv:** For loading environment variables.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with the backend of the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MangeshRShakkarwar/PopCornpal----Backend.git
    cd popcornpal-backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

    ```plaintext
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

4. **Run the server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. The server should now be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Usage

Once the backend server is running, it will handle requests from the frontend application. You can test the API endpoints using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
